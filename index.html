            <p> My name is Glory Emmanuel Aviña and I work at Sandia National Laboratories in Livermore, California. I enjoy applying the scientific method to national security problems. My research focuses on cognitive science, enhancing human performance, and cyber security. I've worked at Sandia for 13 years - 10 years in Albuquerque, NM and 3 years in Livermore.</p>
            <p>I live in Brentwood, CA (~20miles North of Livermore) with my husband (Isaac), one year old little girl (Ariella), and our french poodle ("Ladie" short for Gladiator...long story). We enjoy being outside in the sun (especially on a crisp, autumn day) throwing the frisbee around, and trying new things. Though exhausting and constant, my husband and I both feel like parenthood is the best adventure we've ever experienced.</p>
            <p>My favorite hobby is international travel. I've been to 32 countries and 6 continents. I really enjoy learning about other cultures and different perspectives, as well as seeing how no matter where I am in the world, there are others who share similar joys and frustrations. I'm really passionate about fighting injustice at a global level and hope I will have more opportunities to pursue that.</p>
